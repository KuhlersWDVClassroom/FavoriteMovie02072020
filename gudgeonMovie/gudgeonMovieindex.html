 <p>The incredibles is a movie i would say is one of my favorites in the super hero genre.It mostly follows the 
     same formula of a group of people coming together to stop the antagonist, but there are elements of the movie 
     that make it memorable to me.One such element is the element of mystery present through part of the film.</p>
 <h3>Plot</h3>
 <p>The incredibles starts during a golden age when individulas with powers caled super heroes were everywhere in the world. One of those heroes was 
     Bob Parr, who went by the name of Mr. Incredible who's on his way to his wedding,While he's on his way he 
     rescues a cat, stops a robbery and chases a thief to the top of a building. when he's about to apprehend 
     him another hero known as Elastigirl, his future wife who knocks the thief out.While he's doing this, he meets an innocent fanboy 
     of his named Buddy when he's getting back into his car, he then kicks him out and keeps going on his way to 
     his wedding.While on his way another crime is happening in a tall building and Bob rescues a man falling from 
     the building, although he breaks the man's neck.He attemps to stop the criminal responsible but is stopped by
      Buddy,who gets in the way.After this he finally goes to his wedding.After the wedding a movement springs up 
      that calls for Supers to go into retirement due to Bob breaking the neck of the man who was falling. The 
      movement fulfills it's goal and all supers that were alive were forced to go into retirement. 
      We next see Bob years later in a soulless office job and it is revealed he has a rough family life.
      some time later he goes into a burning building with one of the old supers he knew,Frozone to relive the old days and save people.
      Sometime after this he gets contacted by a corporation to take care of a robot gone rogue.
      Bob manages to do this, although with great difficulty.
    Sometime later he gets attacked by an upgrade version of the robot along with an adult Buddy, who decided to call himself Syndrome.
    Bob manages to escape into a body of water and goes into an underwater cave, in that cave he finds a body of one of the heroes he knew, Gazerbeam.
    He then figures out that Gazerbeam carved the word Kronos into the cave.
    Bob leaves the cave and decides to find out what Kronos is.
    After some time he finds his way into a secret part of the corporation's facility and finds a computer that details what Kronos is.
    It's revealed that Syndrome has been killing retired Heroes by using the robot he created as bait and luring them out of hiding.
    Bob then finds out that the final stage of the plan is sending the robot to ravage the city, then Syndrome would swoop in and stop it so he would be seen as a savior.
While trying to get out, Bob gets captured along with his wife and children.
Eventually they manage to break out and go to stop Syndrome,they get to the city and fight the robot with little success at first. 
Eventually they manage to pierce it's power core with it's own arm, shutting it down.
Afterwards they head back home and see that Syndrome is attempting to kidnap their youngest child.
He's about to get away when the child distracts him and gets away.
 As Syndrome goes to get back in his plane, declaring that he'll be back, Bob throws a piece of rubble at the plane throwing Syndrome next to the spinning turbine engines.
He gets unlucky and gets sucked up into the engine due to his cape.
Things start to go back to normal after those events. </p>
